            <p>HDFC Property Fund would look at raising the next round of offshore funds by the middle of next year, after returning the investments made in the initial offshore fund to the investors by March 2016. The company has to return around around Rs 2,500 crore by March, 2016, said K G Krishnamurthy, managing director and CEO of HDFC Property Ventures Ltd.</p>

            <p>The company has completed investments from the first offshore fund of $800 million and a large part of the second offshore fund of $350 million is also committed. It has announced investment of Rs 100 crore into a signature project of Chennai-based property developer True Value Homes (TVH) under the name TVH Titanium City.</p>

            <p>Around $320 million of the total $350 million second fund has also been committed. However, it would look at the next fund, which would also be offshore fund, only by the middle of next year, he added.</p>
