            <p>Chennai-based property developer True Value Homes (TVH) is all set to launch its next Signature project- TVH Titanium City. Titanium City is a 100 acre township located at Manivakkam, West Tambaram, which will have end-to-end facilities.</p>

            <p>HIREF-HDFC International Realty Fund are investing 100 crore in the project. The township will be developed in four phases, with the first phase set to have 25 Acres of plotted development.</p>

            <p>The next 3 phases will see the launch of Row Houses, Villas, Apartments and Commercial developments. The project is being developed in association with HDFC Property Fund.</p>

            <p>Speaking at the launch, N.Ravichandran, Chairman, TVH spoke of the need for a well-planned project like this. “For the last 18 years, at TVH, we have been continuously developing and delivering world-class homes and offices.” TVH Titanium City Township is visualized and planned to give the best facilities and a holistic quality of life to its customers.</p>

            <p>The township has convenient access to NH45, NH4, NH5 and NH205 and will boast of internal roads that are 40-60 feet wide. Set along the Manivakkam Lake, there will be no shortage of water either. The Adyar canal also runs parallel to the site.</p>

            <p>The project has impeccable access from road and rail, with excellent social infrastructure – reputed schools, colleges, hospital and malls alongside.</p>

            <p>“The Township will set the benchmark for the city’s finest real estate developments, aiming to be the most sought after location to invest and live. It is strategically located between the residential area of Tambaram and Industrial areas of Sriperumbudur & Oragadam, not to mention the GST IT Corridor.</p>

            <p>We expect to attract end users from these areas by giving them the advantage of a higher standard of living through better infrastructure and better amenities when compared to small, standalone projects in these areas,” he explained further.</p>

            <p>According to TVH, the location will favour investors as well, as it is currently an important junction of the city.Other locations equidistant to the GST road, such as Tambaram, Guduvancheri, Vandalur and Oragadam are priced 50-100% higher.</p>

            <p>Oragadam industrial belt which currently has over 1 Lakh people working, is set to grow to about half a million in the next 5 years, which will increase the need for quality housing rapidly. TVH expects the city to expand into this region, which would get a good return for buyers on their investment.</p>

            <p>While addressing the media, Mr. K.G. Krishnamurthy, CEO & MD, HDFC-HIREF said, “We are happy to associate with TVH on this project not only because of their successful track record but also because we have established a long 20 year relationship in their earlier completed projects at Chennai and Coimbatore.</p>

            <p>We chose to associate with The Titanium project from TVH because it has been designed to attract the affordable middle class and lower middle class segment just on the outskirts of Tambaram and that too at significantly lower costs than prevailing ones in Tambaram. We are investing 100 crores in this project in return for a 26% equity stake and are confident about handsome returns within the next seven years when the project will be completed.”</p>
